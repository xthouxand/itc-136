NOETS FOR 5/18/2017

How do i get to command mode: <ESC>

:

:wq (write and quit)

Particular line number
:34

Line:
go to end of line $
go to start of line 0

File:
Go to top of file gg
Go to bottom of file :$

delete line:
dd

undo:
u

working on multuple files at once: 
plit filename

*to move between windows ctl-w-w or ctl-w ctl-w

:hide
gets rid of window (you'll be prompted to save changes before....)

Search
/whatyou' researchingfor
(press n to go to the next match)

Modes:
i for insert mode (so i can type things)
escape to get back to command mode

writing and exiting
:wq! write and quit no matter what. (! forces the command)
:w writes the file without quiting
:wq writes and quites but if there is an error it will stop
:q! quits without writing the file.



Search and replace (the most obtuse of cim commands)

Example
:%s/1/one/g

: (colon) puts us into command mode
%s tells us to search and replace through the entire file
1 is the thing that we are searching for
one is the thing we are replacing /1 with
/g means to do it globally.

* this command will turn 111 into oneoneone ot 102 into one02
