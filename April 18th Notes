I feel like this licenses would be good for those without plain accessibility to resources that the upper class have easy access to. 
With this licenses, the gernal public can rely on something free rather than something that has to be paid for, which will thus hurt the competitor.
This license does not include any type of warrenty so its not really backed up or protected by anything.
If those who are at "detriment" risk such as the heirs and successsors, they are able to revert the changes of the code.
It leaves a lot of legal interpretation in the air. This is a easily manipulative piece of code/software license. 
The license explicitly states that it does NOT provide any warranty and includes limitation of libility.
